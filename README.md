# amp-viewer (https://lihautan.com/amp-viewer)

Copied and tweaked example amp-viewer from the amp project: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml.

So you can view your amp page before deploying it to production.

The amp viewer will contain all the css style hacks that you would expect from the actual amp-viewer from google search results.

## Usage
Key in your url, and press `<Enter>`.

If you are serving from `http://`, you will need to **allow** to load unsafe script.

## Build
You can build this project from the [dev branch](https://github.com/tanhauhau/amp-viewer/tree/dev).
